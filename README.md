# Signal Generator and USB Reader Application

## Overview

This project is a Python application designed for generating and reading signals using a USB interface. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize signals and manage waveform data.

## Features

- **Signal Generation**: Simulates signal generation with adjustable parameters.
- **USB Reader**: Interfaces with USB devices to read incoming data.
- **Waveform Visualization**: Displays signal waveforms using Matplotlib integrated with PySide6.
- **Waveform Saving**: Allows users to save waveform data to CSV files.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
